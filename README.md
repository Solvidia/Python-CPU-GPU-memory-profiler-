# solvidia-mem-prof: a Python CPU+GPU+memory profiler with AI-powered optimization proposals

by [Emery Berger](https://emeryberger.com), [Sam Stern](https://samstern.me/), and [Juan Altmayer Pizzorno](https://github.com/jaltmayerpizzorno).

 
## About solvidia-mem-prof

solvidia-mem-prof is a high-performance CPU, GPU *and* memory profiler for
Python that does a number of things that other Python profilers do not
and cannot do.  It runs orders of magnitude faster than many other
profilers while delivering far more detailed information. It is also
the first profiler ever to incorporate AI-powered proposed
optimizations.

### AI-powered optimization suggestions

> **Note**
>
> To enable AI-powered optimization suggestions, you need to enter an [OpenAI key](https://openai.com/api/) in the box under "Advanced options". _Your account will need to have a positive balance for this to work_ (check your balance at https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).

Once you've entered your OpenAI key (see above), click on the lightning bolt (âš¡) beside any line or the explosion (ðŸ’¥) for an entire region of code to generate a proposed optimization. Click on a proposed optimization to copy it to the clipboard.

<img width="571" alt="example proposed optimization" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1612723/211639968-37cf793f-3290-43d1-9282-79e579558388.png">

You can click as many times as you like on the lightning bolt or explosion, and it will generate different suggested optimizations. Your mileage may vary, but in some cases, the suggestions are quite impressive (e.g., order-of-magnitude improvements).

Using solvidia-mem-prof to profile only specific functions via <code>@profile</code>:
</summary>

Just preface any functions you want to profile with the `@profile` decorator and run it with solvidia-mem-prof:

```Python
# do not import profile!

@profile
def slow_function():
    import time
    time.sleep(3)
```

</details>

#### Web-based GUI

solvidia-mem-prof has both a CLI and a web-based GUI [(demo here)](http://plasma-umass.org/solvidia-mem-prof-gui/).

By default, once solvidia-mem-prof has profiled your program, it will open a
tab in a web browser with an interactive user interface (all processing is done
locally). Hover over bars to see breakdowns of CPU and memory
consumption, and click on underlined column headers to sort the
columns. The generated file `profile.html` is self-contained and can be saved for later use.

## solvidia-mem-prof Overview

### solvidia-mem-prof talk (PyCon US 2021)

[This talk](https://youtu.be/5iEf-_7mM1k) presented at PyCon 2021 walks through solvidia-mem-prof's advantages and how to use it to debug the performance of an application (and provides some technical details on its internals). We highly recommend watching this video!

[![solvidia-mem-prof presentation at PyCon 2021](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plasma-umass/solvidia-mem-prof/master/docs/images/solvidia-mem-prof-video-img.png)](https://youtu.be/5iEf-_7mM1k "solvidia-mem-prof presentation at PyCon 2021")

### Fast and Accurate

- solvidia-mem-prof is **_fast_**. It uses sampling instead of instrumentation or relying on Python's tracing facilities. Its overhead is typically no more than 10-20% (and often less).

- solvidia-mem-prof is **accurate**. We tested CPU profiler accuracy and found that solvidia-mem-prof is among the most accurate profilers, correctly measuring time taken.



- solvidia-mem-prof performs profiling **_at the line level_** _and_ **_per function_**, pointing to the functions and the specific lines of code responsible for the execution time in your program.

### CPU profiling

- solvidia-mem-prof **separates out time spent in Python from time in native code** (including libraries). Most Python programmers aren't going to optimize the performance of native code (which is usually either in the Python implementation or external libraries), so this helps developers focus their optimization efforts on the code they can actually improve.
- solvidia-mem-prof **highlights hotspots** (code accounting for significant percentages of CPU time or memory allocation) in red, making them even easier to spot.
- solvidia-mem-prof also separates out **system time**, making it easy to find I/O bottlenecks.

### GPU profiling

- solvidia-mem-prof reports **GPU time** (currently limited to NVIDIA-based systems).

### Memory profiling

- solvidia-mem-prof **profiles memory usage**. In addition to tracking CPU usage, solvidia-mem-prof also points to the specific lines of code responsible for memory growth. It accomplishes this via an included specialized memory allocator.
- solvidia-mem-prof separates out the percentage of **memory consumed by Python code vs. native code**.
- solvidia-mem-prof produces **_per-line_ memory profiles**.
- solvidia-mem-prof **identifies lines with likely memory leaks**.
- solvidia-mem-prof **profiles _copying volume_**, making it easy to spot inadvertent copying, especially due to crossing Python/library boundaries (e.g., accidentally converting `numpy` arrays into Python arrays, and vice versa).

### Other features

- solvidia-mem-prof can produce **reduced profiles** (via `--reduced-profile`) that only report lines that consume more than 1% of CPU or perform at least 100 allocations.
- solvidia-mem-prof supports `@profile` decorators to profile only specific functions.
- When solvidia-mem-prof is profiling a program launched in the background (via `&`), you can **suspend and resume profiling**.

# Comparison to Other Profilers

## Performance and Features

Below is a table comparing the **performance and features** of various profilers to solvidia-mem-prof.

![Performance and feature comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plasma-umass/solvidia-mem-prof/master/docs/images/profiler-comparison.png)

- **Slowdown**: the slowdown when running a benchmark from the Pyperformance suite. Green means less than 2x overhead. solvidia-mem-prof's overhead is just a 35% slowdown.

solvidia-mem-prof has all of the following features, many of which only solvidia-mem-prof supports:

- **Lines or functions**: does the profiler report information only for entire functions, or for every line -- solvidia-mem-prof does both.
- **Unmodified Code**: works on unmodified code.
- **Threads**: supports Python threads.
- **Multiprocessing**: supports use of the `multiprocessing` library -- _solvidia-mem-prof only_
- **Python vs. C time**: breaks out time spent in Python vs. native code (e.g., libraries) -- _solvidia-mem-prof only_
- **System time**: breaks out system time (e.g., sleeping or performing I/O) -- _solvidia-mem-prof only_
- **Profiles memory**: reports memory consumption per line / function
- **GPU**: reports time spent on an NVIDIA GPU (if present) -- _solvidia-mem-prof only_
- **Memory trends**: reports memory use over time per line / function -- _solvidia-mem-prof only_
- **Copy volume**: reports megabytes being copied per second -- _solvidia-mem-prof only_
- **Detects leaks**: automatically pinpoints lines responsible for likely memory leaks -- _solvidia-mem-prof only_

## Output

If you include the `--cli` option, solvidia-mem-prof prints annotated source code for the program being profiled
(as text, JSON (`--json`), or HTML (`--html`)) and any modules it
uses in the same directory or subdirectories (you can optionally have
it `--profile-all` and only include files with at least a
`--cpu-percent-threshold` of time).  Here is a snippet from
`pystone.py`.

![Example profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plasma-umass/solvidia-mem-prof/master/docs/images/sample-profile-pystone.png)

* **Memory usage at the top**: Visualized by "sparklines", memory consumption over the runtime of the profiled code.
* **"Time Python"**: How much time was spent in Python code.
* **"native"**: How much time was spent in non-Python code (e.g., libraries written in C/C++).
* **"system"**: How much time was spent in the system (e.g., I/O).
* **"GPU"**: (not shown here) How much time spent on the GPU, if your system has an NVIDIA GPU installed.
* **"Memory Python"**: How much of the memory allocation happened on the Python side of the code, as opposed to in non-Python code (e.g., libraries written in C/C++).
* **"net"**: Positive net memory numbers indicate total memory allocation in megabytes; negative net memory numbers indicate memory reclamation.
* **"timeline / %"**: Visualized by "sparklines", memory consumption generated by this line over the program runtime, and the percentages of total memory activity this line represents.
* **"Copy (MB/s)"**: The amount of megabytes being copied per second (see "About solvidia-mem-prof").

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Is there any way to get shorter profiles or do more targeted profiling?
</summary>

**A:** Yes! There are several options:

1. Use `--reduced-profile` to include only lines and files with memory/CPU/GPU activity.
2. Use `--profile-only` to include only filenames containing specific strings (as in, `--profile-only foo,bar,baz`).
3. Decorate functions of interest with `@profile` to have solvidia-mem-prof report _only_ those functions.
4. Turn profiling on and off programmatically by importing solvidia-mem-prof (`import solvidia-mem-prof`) and then turning profiling on and off via `solvidia-mem-prof_profiler.start()` and `solvidia-mem-prof_profiler.stop()`. By default, solvidia-mem-prof runs with profiling on, so to delay profiling until desired, use the `--off` command-line option (`python3 -m solvidia-mem-prof --off yourprogram.py`).
